First of all, I would like to thank my chief supervisor Prof. Lei Zhang for his support and guidance in the past three years. From August 2009, I first worked with him as a Research Assistant and then as a Ph.d student after one year. I was very lucky to work with him because he gave me freedom to select the research topics that I was interested in, and encouraged me to move on when I came up against difficulties. His valuable suggestions always motivated me to do my best and helped me significantly improve the quality of my work.

I want to thank Prof. Ming-Hsuan Yang for his valuable suggestions to my research. I am very thankful for his  very thorough revision of my articles. I am very lucky to have the chance to learn from him.

I would like to express my gratitude to Prof. David Zhang, Prof. Jian Yang, Prof. Zhou Wang, Prof. Xiangchu Feng, and Prof. Qinghua Hu in my Ph.D. study. Their excellent
academic experience greatly helps me do a good research. I want to appreciate my colleagues: Jin Xie, Bo Peng, Shigang Liu, Jifeng Ning, Meng Yang, Lin Zhang, Dongmin Guo, Xingzheng Wang, Feng Liu, Xiaofeng Qu, Jin Xie, Zhizhao Feng, Huaiai Zhang, Jinhua Wang, Pengfei Zhu, Shenlong Wang, Chunwei Song.

There are many other friends I've met along this journey. Here, I am appreciated all of you for sharing the viewpoints and thoughts.

At last, special appreciation goes to my girl friend, Huihui Song. With her understanding and listening, I never felt alone along my road. My deepest gratitude is given to my parents and sister for their
love, sacrifice, encouragement and support throughout my life.
