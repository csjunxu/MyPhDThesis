First and foremost, I want to express my gratitude to my chief-supervisor, Prof. David Zhang, for his support and my co-supervisor, Prof. Lei Zhang, for his wonderful guidance, support and generosity. It is my great pleasure to be a student of them, who are always showing me the right direction, but allowing me to walk the path myself.

I would like to express my gratitude to Prof. Wangmeng Zuo, Prof. Xiangchu Feng
and Prof. Deyu Meng in my Ph.D. study. Their valuable suggestions have greatly help me
to do good research, and I am very thankful for their very constructive suggestions on my
articles. 

I want to express my gratitude to my lab and office mates, for their assistance, for
their encouragement and for the wonderful time in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University I
have shared with them.

Finally, I want to thank my family for inspiring me to pursue this route. I want to
thank them for their endless love, support, and encouragement.
