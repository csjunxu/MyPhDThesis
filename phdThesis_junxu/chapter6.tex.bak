\section{Conclusions}
%
In this thesis, we studied how to build an efficient and effective appearance model for visual tracking via feature selection, feature extraction, and spatio-temporal context learning techniques.

%
we first presented an active feature selection method that selects more informative features than the MIL feature selection method~\cite{Babenko_pami_2011}. The MIL feature selection method selects features that are less discriminative to separate target from complex background. Moreover, more selected features are needed that increases computation burden. Motivated by active learning method, we used the Fisher information criterion for feature selection. The Fisher information criterion measures the uncertainty of the classification models, thereby selecting more informative features than the MIL feature selection method~\cite{Babenko_pami_2011}. Moreover, less number of features are selected, which achieves much efficient performance than the MIL tracker.

%
Although the feature selection methods under the MIL framework demonstrate good performance in visual tracking, different from the traditional MIL~\cite{dietterich1997solving} that does not utilize the prior information of the instance labels in the training procedure, the MIL tracking method utilizes this prior information, which motivates us to consider whether it is necessary to select features under the MIL framework. We further presented an online discriminative feature selection method that is based on the instance level via a supervised learning method. Our feature selection method integrates the prior information of the instance labels and the most correct positive sample (i.e., the tracking result in the current frame) into a simple supervised learning algorithm.

Next, we explored the information from all dimensions rather than only selecting a subsect of dimensions to design an efficient and robust appearance model. A very sparse random matrix was adopted to compress the high-dimensional multiscale image features. Finally, the compressed features were used to build an appearance model that can be efficiently computed via integral image method. The proposed algorithm runs in real-time and performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods on challenging sequences in terms of efficiency, accuracy and robustness.

%
Finally, we exploited the spatio-temporal context information for fast and robust visual tracking. We proposed two local context models (i.e., spatial context and spatio-temporal context models) that are very robust to appearance variations introduced by illumination changes, pose variation, and occlusion, etc. The Fast Fourier Transform can be adopted for online learning and detection. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art algorithms on challenging sequences demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves favorable results in terms
of accuracy, robustness, and speed.

\section{Future Work}
In the future work, we plan to improve the proposed method and design more robust tracking by detection algorithms that take into account the context information in the following three directions.
\begin{itemize}
  \item One issue that needs to be further considered is to design an non-parameter estimation method that takes into account the appearance variations in tracking. In our proposed compressive tracking method, the online parameter update schemes (See~(\ref{eq:onlineupdate})) are adopted to deal with the appearance variations. Although this saves much computation, the estimated parameters may be inaccurate when the target appearance has large scale change, thereby leading to drift problem. The non-parameter estimation method can achieve more accurate estimation by directly learning information from the data. Moreover, in the tracking methods proposed in this thesis, the target scale change is not explicitly considered. Therefore, when there are large scale change, how to learn efficiently and effectively appearance model which is robust to scale change should be well studied in future.
  \item The second issue is that all the proposed tracking algorithms train a classifier to estimate the object location. However, both in the training and detection procedures, the samples have some overlaps among each other, thereby leading to computation redundancy. In our proposed algorithms, we utilize a coarse-to-fine strategy to reduce this redundancy or randomly select a subset of negative samples. However, these are suboptimal methods that may cause less accurate results in tracking. How to find a strategy that is able to reduce computational complexity while still maintaining a high accuracy is still an open problem in future.
   \item Although we have utilized the spatio-temporal context information to build a robust appearance model, the proposed algorithm only takes into account the fixed scale. In practical applications, the target scale may change much, thereby leading to a very challenging task to estimate the scale changes. How to accurately estimate the scale changes in our STC tracker is a future work.
\end{itemize}
