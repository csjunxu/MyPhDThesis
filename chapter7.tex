\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions:sec1}
In this thesis, we proposed several image denoising methods for both synthetic additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and real-world noise. These methods can be categorized into external prior based, hybrid prior based, and internal prior based methods.

We firstly proposed an external prior based denoising method for synthetic AWGN. The proposed Patch Group Prior based image Denoising (PGPD) method extended existing patch based learning scheme \cite{epll} to patch group based learning scheme. This extension improve the patch based denoising method by considering the nonlocal self similarity (NSS) property of natural images. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed PGPD not only achieves highly competitive PSNR results with state-of-the-art denoising methods, but also is highly efficient and preserves better the image edges and textures.

Then we proposed a hybrid prior based method for the real-world image denoising problem. We employed the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to learn the patch group (PG) prior and utilized the learned prior to guide the subspace clustering and dictionary learning for the input noisy image. Extensive experiments on three realistic noisy image datasets, including a new dataset constructed by us by different types of cameras and camera settings, demonstrated that our proposed Guided method achieves much better performance than state-of-the-art image denoising methods in terms of both quantitative measure and perceptual quality.

To fully exploit the internal NSS , we proposed a multi-channel model for real color image denoising. The multi-channel scheme helps to consider the different noise statistics in different channels of the sRGB images. Since the weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM) model has already achieved state-of-the-art performance on the AWGN noise removal, we extended the WNNM model and the proposed Multi-channel WNNM (MCWNNM) model achieved state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real color image denoising problems. 

In the fourth work, we proposed to consider the fact that the noise statistics in different local region of the noisy image. To consider the different noise levels of local region, we introduced two weighting matirces related to the noise statistics of different channels and patches. The proposed trilateral sparse coding scheme can be solved by variable splitting method, and the overall model can be solved alternatively under the famous ADMM framework. The ADMM algorithm is guaranteed to converge since the overall model is convex.

In the final work, we constructed a novel realistic noisy image dataset. In the proposed dataset, we collect 40 images of diffrent scenes. To generate the ``ground truth'' clean images, we captured each scene for over 500 times. The constrcuted dataset is called PolyU Realistic Image dataset. we evaluate the state-of-the-art image denoising methods and the methods developed in this thesis. We evaluate these methods on two previous benchmark datasets and our proposed new one. Extensive experimental results demonstrated that the proposed TWSC method achieved better denoising performance than the other state-of-the-art methods due to the reason of considering the different noise statistics in different local region as well as different channels. Besides, the real-world image denoising problem is still a challenging task and need future study with more promising denoising methods. Our new dataset is a new benchmark for this study direction.



\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions:future}

In the future work, we will study how the constructed dataset can be used to train a discriminative learning based denoising methods. we will also consider how to apply the proposed models to other image restoration tasks such as image super-resolution and image deblurring.
