\section{Section 1}
\label{sec:conclusions:sec1}
In this thesis, I mainly studied the image denoising problem. 

In the first work, I proposed a patch group prior based image denoising (PGPD) method. The proposed PGPD method extended existing patch based learning scheme to patch group based learning scheme. This extension improve the patch based denoising method by considering the non-local self similarity (NSS) property of natural images. This NSS property can make the proposed PGPD method maintains image detail better than patch based methods such as EPLL \cite{epll}. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed PGPD method is both effective and efficient on denoising images corrupted by synthetic additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).

In the second work, I proposed to extend the proposed patch group prior to realistic image denoising problem. In
